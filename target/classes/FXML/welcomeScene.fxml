First, the client picksa category. The server will send the client the number of letters in a word from thatcategory to guess. The client gets to guess a total of six letters, one at a time. Correctguesses do not count towards the six guess total.The client will guess a letter and send it to the server. The server will respond witheither: the letter is in the word and where that letter is located or the letter is not in theword and how many guesses are left.If the client guesses the word within 6 letter guesses, they can not guess at anotherword in the same category but must chose from the two remaining. If they do not guessthe word correctly, they are free to choose from any of the three categories for anotherword. Clients may guess at a maximum of three words per category. If they do not makea correct guess within three attempts, the game is over. The game is won when theclient successfully guesses one word in each category. When the game is over, theclient can either play again or quit." textAlignment="CENTER" wrappingWidth="599.21630859375" />
